<h3>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h3>

- We experienced several obstacles during different Github push/pull/merge instances.<br>
    - We realized that coordinating on a firm schedule
      for when to both push to main & pull as a team could eliminate some complications.
- We also became more savvy with troubleshooting Github errors in general, and were able
  to overcome some issues by running local manual merges.<br>
- Utilizing Bootstrap Flex Box more in general was a learning experience for our group.</li>
